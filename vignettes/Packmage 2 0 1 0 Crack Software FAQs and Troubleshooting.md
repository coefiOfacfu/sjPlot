# How to Upgrade to 3DMark Port Royal and Test Your Ray Tracing Performance
  
If you are a gamer who wants to test the real-time ray tracing performance of your graphics card, you might be interested in upgrading to 3DMark Port Royal. Port Royal is a benchmark that uses Microsoft DirectX Raytracing to render realistic reflections, shadows, and lighting effects. In this article, we will show you how to upgrade to 3DMark Port Royal and how to use it to measure your ray tracing performance.
  
## What is 3DMark Port Royal?
  
3DMark Port Royal is a benchmark that was released in January 2019 as an optional upgrade for 3DMark, a popular tool for testing and comparing the performance of gaming PCs. Port Royal is the world's first dedicated real-time ray tracing benchmark for gamers[^1^]. It shows you how well your PC handles ray tracing effects in real-time.

Ray tracing is a technique that simulates the behavior of light in a 3D scene. It can create realistic reflections, shadows, and lighting effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional rendering methods. Ray tracing is a computationally intensive process that requires a graphics card that supports Microsoft DirectX Raytracing, such as NVIDIA GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon RX 6000 series cards.

## How to Upgrade to 3DMark Port Royal?
  
If you bought 3DMark after January 8, 2019, you already have the Port Royal upgrade included. You can run the Port Royal benchmark from the 3DMark app on Steam or from the standalone version.
  
If you bought 3DMark before January 8, 2019, you need to buy the Port Royal upgrade separately. The upgrade costs $2.99 and adds new tests and features for testing the real-time ray tracing and DLSS performance of the latest graphics cards[^2^]. The upgrade includes:
  
- The Port Royal ray tracing benchmark
- The Port Royal Stress Test
- Custom benchmark settings for Port Royal
- The DirectX Raytracing feature test
- The NVIDIA DLSS feature test

You can buy the Port Royal upgrade from Steam or from the UL website.
  
## How to Use 3DMark Port Royal?
  
Once you have upgraded to 3DMark Port Royal, you can run the benchmark from the 3DMark app. To run the benchmark, you need to have the Windows 10 October 2018 Update and a graphics card with drivers that support Microsoft DirectX Raytracing.
  
The benchmark takes about five minutes to complete and consists of two parts:

1. A ray tracing demo that showcases realistic reflections, shadows, and lighting effects in a futuristic sci-fi scene.
2. A performance test that measures your average frame rate while running the demo.

After running the benchmark, you will see your score and a detailed report of your system's performance. You can compare your score with other users who have similar hardware configurations on the 3DMark website or app. You can also see how overclocking affects your ray tracing performance by adjusting your GPU settings and running the benchmark again.
  
If you want to check the stability and reliability of your system after overclocking or upgrading your graphics card, you can use the Port Royal Stress Test. The stress test runs the same demo as the benchmark but for a longer period of time. It also monitors your GPU temperature and clock speed. If your system passes the stress test without crashing or overheating, it means that it is stable under heavy load.
  
If you want to test how different ray tracing settings affect your performance, you can use the custom benchmark settings for Port Royal. You can change the resolution, anti-aliasing mode, ray tracing quality level, and DLSS mode (if supported by your graphics card). You can also enable or disable V-Sync and FPS limit.
  
## Conclusion
  
3DMark Port Royal is a great way to test and compare the real-time ray tracing performance of your graphics card. It is an optional upgrade for 3DMark that costs $2.99 and adds new tests and features for testing ray tracing and DLSS. You can run the benchmark
