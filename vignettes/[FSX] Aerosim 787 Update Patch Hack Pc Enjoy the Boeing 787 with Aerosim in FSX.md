# How to Update and Patch Aerosim 787 for FSX
 
If you are a fan of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and want to fly it in Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), you might be interested in the payware add-on by Aerosim[^1^]. This add-on package includes two variants of the Boeing 787-8 with realistic liveries, models, sounds, animations, and systems. You can also enjoy features such as the Head Up Display (HUD), the Terrain Display on EFIS, and the FMS that works with the FSX flight planner[^5^].
 
However, some users have reported issues with the Aerosim 787, such as missing textures, incorrect gauges, or crashes. To fix these problems, you need to update and patch your Aerosim 787 with the latest files from the developer. Here are the steps to do that:

3. Copy and paste the contents of the `AS_B787_FSX` folder to your FSX installation folder, usually located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X`. Overwrite any existing files when prompted.
4. If you have installed the expansion package of the Aerosim 787, copy and paste the contents of the `AS_B787_FSX_Expansion` folder to your FSX installation folder as well. Overwrite any existing files when prompted.
5. Download the latest patch file from the Aerosim website. The file name is `AS_B787_FSX_Patch.zip` and it is located in the same `Download` section as before. You need to log in with your account to access the file.
6. Extract the contents of the zip file to a temporary folder. You should see one folder: `Patch`. This folder contains several files that fix some bugs and errors in the Aerosim 787.
7. Copy and paste the contents of the `Patch` folder to your FSX installation folder. Overwrite any existing files when prompted.

- Before starting the engines, make sure you have enough fuel and payload for your flight. You can use the TDS Utility panel to adjust these values. To access the TDS Utility panel, press Shift+8 on your keyboard. You can also use this panel to control the wing flex, the cabin lights, the ground services, and the animations of the doors and cargo bays[^2^].
- To start the engines, you can use the Ctrl+E shortcut or follow the Aerosim manual. The manual is located in the `Documents` folder of your FSX installation. It contains detailed instructions on how to operate the Aerosim 787 systems, such as the FMS, the autopilot, the electrical system, and the hydraulic system.
- To use the FMS, you need to create a flight plan with the FSX flight planner first. Then, you can enter the flight plan data into the FMS by using the CDU (Control Display Unit) on the pedestal. You can also use the CDU to set up your performance data, such as your cruise altitude, your speed, and your weight. The FMS will then calculate your V-speeds, your takeoff thrust, and your optimal flight profile[^1^].
- To use the HUD (Head Up Display), you need to press Shift+2 on your keyboard. This will bring up a 2D panel with a transparent screen that shows you important flight information, such as your speed, your altitude, your attitude, and your flight path. You can use the HUD to assist you during takeoff and landing, especially in low visibility conditions[^1^].
- To use the Terrain Display on EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System), you need to press Shift+3 on your keyboard. This will bring up a 2D panel with a map that shows you the terrain elevation around your aircraft. You can use this feature to avoid terrain collisions or to plan your approach to an airport with complex terrain[^1^].

These are just some of the tips for flying Aerosim 787 in FSX. For more information, you can refer to the Aerosim manual or watch some tutorials on YouTube[^2^] [^3^].
