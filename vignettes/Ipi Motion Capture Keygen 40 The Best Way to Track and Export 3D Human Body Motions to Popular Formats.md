One of the advantages of Ipi Motion Capture is that it is markerless, meaning that you don't need to wear any special clothing or attach any markers to your body. You just need a clear space and a suitable camera setup. This makes it easy to use and reduces the cost and time of motion capture production.
 
Another advantage of Ipi Motion Capture is that it is scalable, meaning that you can adjust the number and type of cameras according to your needs and budget. You can start with a simple setup using one or two Kinect sensors or PlayStation Eye cameras, and then upgrade to a more advanced setup using more cameras or depth sensors. You can also use different camera configurations to capture different body parts or multiple actors.
 
Ipi Motion Capture also offers a number of features and options to enhance your motion capture experience, such as:
 
- Automatic calibration and background subtraction
- Real-time tracking and preview
- Motion transfer and retargeting
- Biomechanical analysis and feedback
- Automation and scripting
- Mocap contest and customer highlights

Ipi Motion Capture is a tool that can help you create realistic animations in a matter of minutes. Whether you are a studio, freelance animator or hobbyist, there is a license for you. Don't miss this opportunity to get a scalable and affordable solution for 3D animation.
  
## Step 1: Prepare your capture space and camera setup
 
You need to have a clear space of at least 2.5 x 2.5 meters for a single actor, or more for multiple actors. You also need to have a suitable camera setup, depending on the number and type of cameras you want to use. You can check the recommended camera setups on their website[^1^]. You need to connect your cameras to your computer and make sure they are recognized by the software.
  
## Step 2: Calibrate your cameras and background
 
You need to calibrate your cameras and background using the software. This will help the software to track your motions accurately and remove any unwanted objects from the background. You can use a calibration tool, such as a checkerboard pattern or a wand, to help the software to align your cameras. You can also use a background subtraction tool, such as a green screen or a plain wall, to help the software to isolate your body from the background.
  
## Step 3: Record your motions
 
You need to record your motions using the software. You can use a motion controller, such as a PlayStation Move or an Xbox controller, to start and stop the recording. You can also use voice commands or keyboard shortcuts. You can see a real-time preview of your motions on the screen and adjust your position and posture accordingly. You can record as many takes as you want and save them for later processing.
