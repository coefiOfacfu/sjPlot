# Review: Audio Damage Dr. Device 1.0 VST - A Hi-Octane Analog-Style Effect
 
If you are looking for a versatile and powerful effect plugin that can spice up your tracks with some analog flavor, you might want to check out Audio Damage Dr. Device 1.0 VST. This plugin combines a multi-mode filter and a stereo bucket-brigade delay in one package, with an intuitive and fun XYZ control pad that lets you modulate various parameters with ease.
 
The filter section of Dr. Device features six different modes: 4-pole lowpass, 3-pole lowpass, 2-pole lowpass, 4-pole highpass, 2-pole highpass, and 4-pole bandpass. You can adjust the cutoff frequency, resonance, drive, and bit reduction of the filter, as well as the input and output levels. The filter can self-oscillate at high resonance settings, creating some interesting tones and noises.

The delay section of Dr. Device offers two filtering modes: clean and dirty. The clean mode is a transparent delay with adjustable time, feedback, and mix. The dirty mode adds some saturation and modulation to the delay signal, creating some warm and gritty sounds. You can sync the delay time to the host tempo or set it manually in milliseconds.
 
The XYZ control pad of Dr. Device is where the magic happens. You can assign any of the filter or delay parameters to the X, Y, or Z axis of the pad, and then drag your mouse or use a hardware controller to manipulate them in real time. You can also record your movements on the pad and play them back with different speed and direction options. The pad also has a kinetics feature that adds some random motion to the parameters.
 
Audio Damage Dr. Device 1.0 VST is a great plugin for adding some character and movement to your sounds. It can create anything from subtle enhancements to extreme transformations, depending on how you tweak the settings and use the XYZ pad. It works well on drums, synths, guitars, vocals, and more. It is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X, and supports VST and AU formats.
 
You can download a free demo version of Dr. Device from Audio Damage's website or buy the full version for $49 USD.
