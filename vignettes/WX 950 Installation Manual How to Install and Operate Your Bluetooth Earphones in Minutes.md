# How to Install the WX 950 Stormscope Weather Mapping Sensor
 
The WX 950 Stormscope is a weather mapping sensor that displays lightning activity and storm cells on a CRT screen. It can help pilots avoid hazardous weather conditions and plan their flight routes accordingly. The WX 950 consists of two main components: a display/processor unit and an antenna. This article will provide a brief overview of how to install the WX 950 Stormscope in your aircraft.
 
Before you begin, you will need the following equipment:

- The WX 950 display/processor unit and antenna, supplied by Goodrich Avionics Systems.
- A power cable, a heading input cable, an inhibit line, and a remote clear line, fabricated according to the specifications in the WX 950 installation manual[^1^].
- A doubler plate, screws, washers, nuts, and sealant for mounting the antenna.
- A multimeter, an oscilloscope, a signal generator, and a heading simulator for testing purposes.

The installation process involves the following steps:

1. Unpack and inspect the WX 950 components for any damage or defects.
2. Perform a pre-installation test to verify the functionality of the display/processor unit and the antenna.
3. Select a suitable location for the antenna on the aircraft skin, avoiding any interference sources or skin currents. The antenna should be aligned with the aircraft longitudinal axis, mounted on a flat surface with a sufficient ground plane, and positioned away from the slipstream.
4. Cut a hole in the aircraft skin according to the dimensions of the antenna base. Attach the doubler plate to the underside of the skin with screws, washers, nuts, and sealant. Secure the antenna to the doubler plate with screws and washers.
5. Select a suitable location for the display/processor unit in the cockpit, ensuring good visibility and accessibility. The unit should be mounted on a flat surface with adequate ventilation and clearance.
6. Route the antenna cable, the power cable, the heading input cable, the inhibit line, and the remote clear line from the display/processor unit to their respective sources. Connect the cables to the mating connector on the back of the unit according to the wiring diagram in the installation manual[^1^].
7. Perform a post-installation checkout to verify the operation of the WX 950 system. Check the controls, indicators, modes, and functions of the display/processor unit. Check the signal quality and noise level of the antenna. Check the heading input accuracy and alignment. Check for any electrical interference or malfunctions.

The WX 950 Stormscope is a valuable tool for enhancing situational awareness and safety in flight. It can display lightning activity and storm cells in various modes and ranges, allowing the pilot to see the location, intensity, and movement of weather phenomena. It can also display heading, track, and bearing information, as well as user-defined waypoints and flight plans.
 
The WX 950 Stormscope has a simple and intuitive user interface, consisting of a knob, a button, and a CRT screen. The knob can be used to adjust the brightness, contrast, and range of the display. The button can be used to switch between different modes and functions. The screen can show different symbols and colors to indicate different types of lightning and storm cells. The screen can also show text messages and menus to provide additional information and options.
 
The WX 950 Stormscope requires minimal maintenance and calibration. It has a self-test feature that can detect and report any faults or errors in the system. It also has a service menu that can provide system data, fault logs, CRT test patterns, and noise monitors for troubleshooting purposes. The WX 950 Stormscope installation manual contains detailed instructions on how to access and use these features.
