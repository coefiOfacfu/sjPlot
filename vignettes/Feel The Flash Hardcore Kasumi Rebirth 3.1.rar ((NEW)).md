This paper by RJ Cominsky in 1994, which has been cited 329 times, presents the results of a study on the performance of Superpave road compounds. Superpave is a system for designing and evaluating asphalt mixtures that can withstand different climatic and traffic conditions. The paper includes an appendix that explains the designation of Superpave compounds based on their properties and specifications. ... One of the main findings of the paper is that rotary compaction is essential for achieving the desired density and strength of Superpave compounds. Rotary compaction involves applying a rotating force to the asphalt mixture during construction. The paper shows how rotary compaction can improve the durability and resistance of Superpave compounds to rutting, cracking and moisture damage. ... However, the paper also acknowledges some limitations and challenges of using Superpave compounds. For instance, there is limited experience with Superpave mixes that contain mineral fillers or additives, which may affect their workability and performance. ... Therefore, the paper recommends that quality control measures should be implemented in the production and placement of Superpave compounds. These include using appropriate equipment and methods for mixing, transporting and testing the asphalt mixtures. ... Moreover, the paper suggests that some Superpave compounds may be suitable for in-place compaction, which means compacting the asphalt mixture on the road surface rather than in a plant. This could reduce the costs and environmental impacts of road construction. ... The paper reports that a rotary compactor was used to compact Superpave compounds on site in some of the projects evaluated in the study. The paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this technique and provides some recommendations for its future use.
  
The paper also compares the performance of Superpave compounds with conventional asphalt mixtures in terms of their rutting and cracking resistance. The paper presents the results of laboratory and field tests that measured the rut depth and crack width of different asphalt mixtures after exposure to various temperatures and loads. The paper shows that Superpave compounds generally performed better than conventional mixtures in resisting rutting and cracking, especially at high temperatures and heavy traffic. The paper attributes this to the superior design and compaction of Superpave compounds, which ensure a more uniform and stable structure of the asphalt mixture.

Furthermore, the paper evaluates the effect of moisture on the durability of Superpave compounds. Moisture damage is a common problem in asphalt pavements, as water can infiltrate the asphalt mixture and weaken its bond with the aggregate. The paper describes the methods used to assess the moisture susceptibility of Superpave compounds, such as measuring their tensile strength and permeability after immersion in water. The paper reports that Superpave compounds exhibited a high resistance to moisture damage, as they had a low permeability and a high tensile strength compared to conventional mixtures. The paper explains that this is due to the use of modified binders and mineral fillers in Superpave compounds, which enhance their cohesion and adhesion.
  
In conclusion, the paper demonstrates that Superpave compounds are a promising technology for improving the performance and longevity of asphalt pavements. The paper provides evidence that Superpave compounds can withstand different climatic and traffic conditions better than conventional mixtures, as they have a higher resistance to rutting, cracking and moisture damage. The paper also highlights some of the challenges and opportunities of using Superpave compounds, such as the need for quality control, the possibility of in-place compaction and the potential for further research and development.
